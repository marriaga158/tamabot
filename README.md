# tamabot

This is the source code for the Tamagotchii-like bot I wrote over quarantine summer break, written entirely in C# and using Discord.NET.
Some of the C# code may not be formatted in a "best practice" because I entered the language mostly blind, with only Java experience.

This bot is heavily inspired by the Tatsugotchii function in the Tatsumaki bot found at https://tatsu.gg. If you are from the Tatsumaki dev team and want me to take this bot offline or remove this repo, just let me know.

The bot is still in development and may get a full cloud deployment at some point, so if you want to give the bot a try and break things join the development server here https://discord.gg/TwKehqu

As of 4/29 Tama is currently not being hosted anywhere due to lack of interest. If you're still interested in adding Tama to your server, message me on Discord, either through the invite link or directly at @kelp#6063
