# tamabot

This is the source code for the Tamagotchii-like bot I wrote over quarantine summer break, written entirely in C# and using Discord.NET.
Some of the C# code may not be formatted in a "best practice" because I entered the language mostly blind, with only Java experience.

This bot is heavily inspired by the Tatsugotchii function in the Tatsumaki bot found at https://tatsu.gg. If you are from the Tatsumaki dev team and want me to take this bot offline or remove this repo, just let me know.
